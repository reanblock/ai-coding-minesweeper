# AI Coding Examples 

## Minesweeper

Lets use AI to build a Minesweeper clone in the browser!

## Setup

Here is how I generated Minesweeper using `aider`:

Set my `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file.

Run `aider` which uses the following models:

```bash
Aider v0.69.1
Main model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with diff edit format
Weak model: gpt-4o-mini
Git repo: .git with 4 files
Repo-map: using 1024 tokens, auto refresh
```

Run in aider terminal:

```
/architect Make a minesweeper game using html, js and css
```
